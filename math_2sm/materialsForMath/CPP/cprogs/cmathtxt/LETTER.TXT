Design Software                           CMATH Numerical Methods
-----------------------------------------------------------------

     CMATH is a collection of mathematical routines written in  C.  
They include routines to perform the basic numerical operations of 
equation solving, function minimization and function  integration.  
There is also a set of routines for the  manipulation  of  complex 
numbers.

     For each class of operation, the routines in CMATH have  been 
chosen with the emphasis on versatility and robustness.  They have 
similar capabilities to some of the FORTRAN routines available  in 
the  NAG  and  IMSL  libraries.   The  major  areas  of  numerical 
mathematics covered by CMATH are listed in table 1.

     We  take  advantage  of  C's  dynamic  memory  allocation  to 
allocate vector and matrix workspace within  the  CMATH  routines.  
This reduces the number of parameters that need to be passed (when 
compared with the equivalent FORTRAN routine) and allows  the  use 
of larger data sets on MS-DOS microcomputers.

     All of the routines are supplied as machine  readable  source 
code files.  This means that the library can be used on almost any 
machine that boasts a C compiler.  A reference manual is  provided 
and sample "driver" programs are supplied to demonstrate  the  use 
of the routines.

     Prices  for the package are as follows.
