     The CMATH library is a collection  of  mathematical  routines 
written in the C programming language.  They include  routines  to 
perform  the  basic  numerical  operations  of  equation  solving, 
quadrature and function minimization and have similar capabilities 
to some of the FORTRAN routines available  in  the  IMSL  and  NAG 
libraries.  There is also a set of routines for  the  manipulation 
of complex numbers.  

The major areas of numerical mathematics covered by CMATH are ...

Interpolation and Differentiation
   Interpolate, differentiate or integrate using a cubic spline.
   Interpolate or differentiate using a B-spline.
   Interpolate or differentiate using a Chebyshev polynomial.
   Fit a cubic spline using least squares.
   Fit a polynomial using least squares.

Matrices and Linear Equations
   Decompose and solve a general matrix equation.
   Invert a general matrix.
   Decompose and solve a banded matrix equation.
   Solve a tridiagonal system of equations.
   Compute the Eigenvalues of a general real matrix. (QR method)
   Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of a general matrix.
   Decompose and solve an MxN matrix equation.
   Decompose and solve a COMPLEX system of equations.

Nonlinear Equations
   Solve a single nonlinear equation.
   Solve a set of nonlinear equations.
   Find the roots of a polynomial.

Minimization
   Minimize a function using function values only.
   Minimize a well behaved function. (Conjugate gradient method)

Quadrature
   Fixed rule Gaussian quadrature.
   Adaptive Gaussian quadrature.
   Adaptive Newton-Cotes quadrature.
   Integration over an infinite domain.

Integration of Ordinary Differential Equations
   Integrate a set of nonstiff ODE's. (Runge-Kutta method)
   Integrate a set of stiff ODE's.  (Multi-step method)

Fourier Transforms
   Fast Fourier transform of a complex array.
   Discrete Fourier transform of a general length array.

Extras
   An integrated package for COMPLEX arithmetic.
   Sort an array of numbers into ascending order.
   Translate CMATH error codes to English text.

     The routines are supplied as machine readable source code  on 
MS-DOS 5.25" discs.  We have used the library on a large range  of 
machines and compilers including ... 
.  MS-DOS micro-computers running Turbo-C, Microsoft-C and 
   HI-TECH C compilers;
.  UNIX workstations such as Hewlett-Packard series 9000, 
   Sun series 3 and Silicon Graphics' Personal IRIS;
.  minicomputers manufactured by Perkin Elmer, Pyramid and DEC;
.  mainframes such as the IBM 3081 and the Convex C1.
We think that the routines are fairly portable!

     A 140 page reference manual is provided  and  sample  drivers 
are supplied to demonstrate the use of  the  routines.   For  each 
routine, the manual includes the following details.
1.  The purpose of the routine.
2.  Instructions on how to call the routine including explanations
    of all input and output parameters.
3.  A brief description of the algorithm used.
4.  A reference to further literature on the algorithm.
5.  A sample driver coded in C.
6.  The output expected from the sample driver.
The sample drivers may also be used to reduce your  coding  effort 
when starting a new application.
